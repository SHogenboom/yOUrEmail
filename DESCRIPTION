Description: The Teachers of the Psychology Department of the Open Universiteit (NLD) receive the to-be-graded papers via their work e-mail. Each teacher then has to perform a set of manual steps such as saving the attachments to a local folder. This package serves to reduce the workload of teachers by automating some of these steps.
